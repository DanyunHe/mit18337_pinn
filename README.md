## Exploration of a discrete-time physices informed neural network

This project explores the physics-informed neural networks. In particular, we use the implicit Runge-Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages to solve one-dimensional Burgerâ€™s Equation. The neural network is implemented in Julia and we vary different parameters including number of time-step size, number of stages in Runge-Kutta and different neural network structures and discuss their performance in final prediction. We also investigate different sampling strategies for more efficient training.
